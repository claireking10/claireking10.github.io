            <h1>Residue Contact Map Clustering</h1>
            <p>Developed a Python script to cluster residue-contact-maps using the HDBSCAN algorithm, 
                        enhancing the analysis of protein structures. This project involved data preprocessing, 
                        algorithm implementation, and result visualization to identify significant structural patterns.</p>

            <h3>Project Details</h3>
            <p>Residue contact maps are used to analyze protein structures and identify significant interactions between amino acid residues. In the Cheng Lab, we aim to develop multi-targeted drugs
                to prevent and reverse Alzheimer's Disease by targeting multiple proteins involved in the disease pathway. To better understand the structural features of these proteins, we implemented the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to analyze residue contact maps derived from molecular dynamics simulations.
                This pipeline can also be applied to other proteins of interest in drug discovery, in particular thoes that look at protein dimer interactions.</p>
